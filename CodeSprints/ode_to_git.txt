Oh git!
you may confuse me now,
but later you will make me less confused,

because I'll take a course,
named Data Science God!

and perhaps more and more amused

fork and clone seems harder,
but after some panic it is easy to understand,
my projects will be in order thanks to git.
Thank you git!

Who knows why we do the things we do.

You keep my data safe,
even when it's just cat memes
